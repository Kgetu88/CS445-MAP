Modern Web Browser
The functionality of a browser is that provides a way to look at and
 interact with all the information on the World Wide Web.
 
The modern web browsers designed in combination of 
1	Cascading Style Sheet (CSS): which is for styling and lay out the web
2	Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML): which is used to define 
     the structure and semantics of the web page.
3	JavaScript: which is used for making the web page interactive (dynamic/live).

 Currently web browsers are multi process browser (they execute multi tasks simultaneously).
 When web browsers are operating (working), they follow those steps 
1.	Handling user input: 
2.	Sending a URL request
3.	Preparing a renderer process
4.	Committing navigation
5.	Rendering page

 JavaScript engine optimizes execution of JavaScript code by 
1	 Standard interpreter: Compilation and running are the same time (just -in-time compiler).
2	 Automatic garbage collation (unreachable variable or data removing)
3	Callstack calls a function from the memory heap and after executing removes it from the stack.
